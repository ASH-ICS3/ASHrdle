# ðŸŽ‰ Unit 3 Summative: <br> Create Your Own ASH Wordle! ðŸŽ‰
</div>

## Overview
Welcome to the exciting world of coding and collaboration! In this assignment, you and a partner (from the other class) will collaborate to create a fun and interactive version of Wordle (ASH Style) using JavaScript. You'll work together using GitHub to manage your code, commit your progress daily, and pull updates from your repository. By the end of this project, you'll have a fully functional website where users can guess a 5-letter word, with color-coded feedback just like the popular, and boring game Wordle! ðŸŒŸ

## Objectives
- **Collaborate** with a partner from a different class using GitHub.
- **Develop** a web-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
